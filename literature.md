## Data Schemas

"Usually when you're talking to a database you want to get some specific pieces of data out of it: I'd like the price, I'd like the quantity, I'd like the customer. As soon as you are doing that what you are doing is setting up an implicit schema. You are assuming that an order has a price field. You are assuming tha is called 'price', not cost, or 'price to customer' or whatever. That implicit schema is still in place and you've got to manage that implicit schema in many ways in a similar approach that you manage the relational database."
From [Introduction to NoSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I#t=11m30) by Martin Fowler.

## Schema Changes
"Document databases are really cool… until you have to make a breaking change to the schema. Then it feels like “good luck with all that!” :D"
